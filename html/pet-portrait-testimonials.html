          <p>Hi Katja</p>
          <p>Both Alison love the Siberian Stretching Tiger and it is marvelous how you have captured the relief on his
            face whilst stretching.</p>
          <p>But we shamefully admit that our favourite is the Polar Bears. This is perhaps because we always wanted the
            bears and because the beauty makes them “come alive” but then so does your Tiger ……. </p>
          <p>I guess we love them both but as you can see from the pictures, your Polar Bears allow our home to be a
            home. Exquisite indeed. Lots of love from the USA.</p>
          <p>I will regroup and establish contact again. Don't forget us in the meantime.</p>
          <p>Take care.</p>

          <p>Thanks to you Katja, my boy will live forever! The drawing looks so much alive that it seems A'Tim could
            just jump out of the frame any time!</p>
          <p>I must admit that I used to be a little skeptical about drawings or paintings of pets. A painting could
            look very nice, but somehow I couldn't believe someone would be able to reflect the real soul of my own dog
            and the exact expression of his eyes and temperament.</p>
          <p>Well, I have to reconsider my point of view….</p>
          <p>I wanted my boy just the way he is, in full action, charismatic and with the fire in his eyes that is so
            typical for him. This was a pretty difficult assignment, but you succeeded with glamour! People who didn't
            even know I had him painted, immediately saw that it was him, although I have more dogs. </p>
          <p>I'm very proud of the drawing. It will get a place of honor in my house and it will "shine" on my car!</p>
          <p>My other boys can't wait for me to take a good action picture from them too to join the gallery!</p>

          <p>I now left it at the framer, a beautiful, slightly colorful frame and antique styled. It will look

          <p>Oh, she CRIED and CRIED and CRIED and CRIED. Mom was totally unprepared and really didn`t have a clue. I
            first gave her a greeting card I made myself and my brother printed it on a beautiful and expensive paper.
            In it was a print of the painting from your web site.</p>
          <p>She was really happy and besides that there was couple hundred crowns. This money was for a frame, but of
            course she didn`t understand that...</p>
          <p>Then I told her to wait a moment and ran to get the package as I went towards her, she starred at me and
            understood right away as she saw the size of the package. She bursted into tears, didn`t even take the
            package at first.</p>
          <p>She was REALLY HAPPY and than she wanted to phone and thank all people who helped buy the painting
            (grandmother, grandfather, my brother, my dad, her sister & brother)and she didn`t even have time to say
            "hi, it`s Carin" before she bursted into tears again.</p>
          <p>So I had to take over the phone all the time =&#41; She tried to call you yesterday but you weren`t at
            home, only your son. But on the other hand she probably wouldn`t be able to talk anyway =&#41; =&#41; =&#41;
          </p>
          <p>Chiquita meant so VERY MUCH TO HER, on a way that no other dog could ever do. She was saying all evening:
            "she is alive, she is alive! Do you see her eyes? She is really alive!" when she looked at the painting.
            This couldn`t be better, I promise you.</p>
          <p>I have almost never seen my mother this emotional and I think it even came as a shock to her. Thank you
            DEAR KATJA for a really wonderful painting. There are many of us who are lyrical over this you have to
            belive =&#41;</p>

          <p>I finally got the portrait of Taisho back from the framers' and it looks great! I put it on a wall in our
            master bedroom and had my wife close her eyes while I stood her right in front of it.</p>
          <p>I told her this was her belated and now long-awaited birthday gift that she was surely going to love -- and
            so of course she couldn't imagine what it was -- and she was brought to tears.</p>
          <p>It's such a lovely portrait. You really captured his character and this is a piece of art we'll cherish the
            rest of our lives.</p>
          <p>I'm really happy with how it turned out and feel so lucky to have kept digging on the Internet until I
            found you -- all the way in Sweden.</p>
          <p>The framers, who have seen it all, were really impressed with your work too. The eyes, the depth to the
            work -- they were pretty astonished.</p>

          <p>The portrait of Darla is so lovely, words can't express how beautiful it is, except to say "it is so
            beautiful." It captures her perfectly. Thank you so much! And the artist Katja, you chose well, is truly

          <p>Agnes really show full focus and concentration on the next obstacle. With mane and tail that flies (and the

          <p>Dear Katja,</p>
          <p>I am speechless. It is the most beautiful portrait I have ever seen. Maybe I'm biased, but I think this is
            your best one. No all of them of great, but I think this is the best. Black dogs are not only a difficult
            challenge to photograph, but also to paint. You made it look pretty easy.</p>
          <p>I am amazed and positive that the real portrait is even better than what I'm seeing here on the computer. I
            just don't know how to thank someone who helped so much to restore my wonderful and happy memories of these
            beautiful dogs I had in my life for 13 years.</p>
          <p>This portrays Katie and Quinn in their prime. You have captured their personality through their eyes. Katie
            was the more serious one, most of the time.</p>
          <p>Quinn was the forever puppy; he was always ready to play until his very last day. This painting and the
            process you and I went through together, has done so much to subdue the sadness of the last chapter in Katie
            and Quinn's lives.</p>
          <p>his is most inadequate Katja, but thank you from the bottom of my broken, but now healing heart.</p>

          <p>Hi Katja!</p>
          <p>Thank you for the portrait of Salvia. You really succeeded to capture her personality and her expressive
            eyes. When we opened the package and saw the painting, it felt like she was with us again. The portrait of
            Salvia really is the memory I always wished to have of my best friend.</p>

          <p>Hi Katja,</p>
          <p>I am thrilled with Lilo's watercolor portrait that I received today! Not only is it artistic, but it really
            does capture his personality. I can't wait to have it framed and displayed. This will be a beautiful
            keepsake that I will treasure for the rest of my life.</p>
          <p>hank you for making this such an easy process. I really found it comforting and enjoyable to view each
            stage of the your work. I am hoping to get another puppy at the end of the year and I will definitely seek

          <p>We will give the drawing a nice place in our livingroom, next to the one of Zoran. We are very happy with
