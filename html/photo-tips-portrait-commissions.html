        <h2>Photo Is Key</h2>
        <p>
          The photographs I receive and use as references for my artwork is the
          absolutely most significant part of the painting process. Since I work
          from photographs, the completed portrait depends on the quality of the
          photos you send me. Photo is key, so please provide with the best
          photos you have and try to send as many photos as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to photograph your pet specifically for a portrait,
          you might find the information below very helpful.
        </p>

          <h2>Mobile Phone, System Camera or Old Paper-based Photos?</h2>
          <h3>Mobile Phones and Tablets</h3>
          <p>
            Today, it's easier than ever to capture and share precious moments
            thanks to mobile phones and tablets that we carry everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these devices let us snap photos on the go, their quality
            often falls short as a reference for portraits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though good lighting and proximity can help, an artist can easily
            spot the clarity difference between mobile photos and those from a
            high-quality digital camera.
          </p>
          <h3>Old Paper-based Photos</h3>
          <p>
            Many treasured memories are in old analog photos, though they often
            lack portrait quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mail these to my studio for review; usable ones will be scanned in
            high resolution, and the original returned with the artwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your pet is alive, consider taking new digital photos or ask for
            help from family or friends.
          </p>

            src="/assets/images/photo-tips-pet-portraits-from-photos.webp"

          />
          <h2>Positioning And Getting On Your Pets Level</h2>
          <h3>Capturing the Best Angle</h3>
          <p>
            When photographing your pet, avoid looking down at them. Instead,
            capture their image from their eye level, as this perspective aligns
            with how the portrait will be viewed when hung on your wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            For small animals, crouch down to their level or place them on a
            raised surface like a table. For larger pets, standing at their eye
            level is usually sufficient.
          </p>
          <h3>Perfecting the Shot</h3>
          <p>
            Visualize the final photo through the camera lens before clicking
            the shutter—if it looks good, take the shot!
          </p>
          <p>
            Aim to capture your pet gazing slightly to the left or right of the
            camera, as this adds depth and prevents their face from appearing
            flat. Ensure both eyes are visible for a balanced and engaging
            portrait.
          </p>

            alt="Photo of border collie"
          />
          <h2>Natural Lighting</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever it is possible, try to take photos outside in natural
            lighting rather than inside with flash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though it is often preferred to take photos on a sunny day, try
            to avoid photos with strong sunlight or too dark shadows which would
            make the pets colors fade away.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are unable to take photos outside, take photos indoors and
            place your pet close to a window without flash. Some natural
            daylight will
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-flex-item2">

            alt="Photo of a dog filling the entire frame"
          />
          <h2>Fill The Entire Frame</h2>
          <p>
            For a full-body portrait, keep your pet close in the frame with a
            bit of background, ensuring they're the main focus. If your pet is
            too far, the details may not be sharp.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a head and chest portrait, fill the frame with your pet's full
            head and neck without cropping any desired parts. Using a full-body
            shot to zoom in for detail won't work, as zooming often blurs the
            image.
          </p>
          <p>
            I paint only what I see, so it's best to start with clear, close
            images.

          <h2>Photo size</h2>
          <p>
            Try to email me your photos in original size, downloaded directly
            from your camera. If photos are reduced in size they are less clear,
            sharp and much important information is lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amount of pixels can vary depending on which digital camera you
            were using, my own camera creates 5472 x 3648 pixel images.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can accept any large size image though email or dropbox, so please
            send them at their original size.
          </p>
          <p>

          />
          <h2>Be Patient and Have Fun</h2>
          <p>
            Capturing your pet's personality takes time, patience, and a relaxed
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't rush; use treats or toys to keep your pet comfortable, and
            carry a camera to catch those natural, joyful moments. A happy face
            is always the most beautiful!
          </p>
          <p>
            Be creative, and look for spontaneous, “wow” moments in your pet's
            everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your pet has passed and you only have older photos, feel free to
            email them for review; while a large oil painting may not be
            possible, other portrait options are available.
