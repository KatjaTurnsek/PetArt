        <h2>When Commissioning Pet Portraits by Katja Turnsek</h2>

        <h3>Order Cancellation</h3>
        <p>
          If a short deadline wasn't requested, you can have a full refund when
          you cancel your order within 7 days. If you however cancel your order
          after 7 days either before or once the painting process started, you
          will be charged a cancellation fee.
        </p>
        <p>
          The percentage (from 20-50% of total portrait cost) depends on several
          aspects and is to cover costs for payment gateways, time spent on
          administration, emails, mock-ups, painting and work material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your payment will be refunded, minus the cancellation fee. Refunds
          cannot be made to a third party. If you wish to cancel your order,
          please notify me as son as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          You have a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee on all portraits created by me.
          I send work in progress photos to your e-mail so you can watch your
          portrait develop from a simple sketch to a completed portrait. I
          photograph each stage as I work at my easel.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it takes much time and effort for me to keep you regularly updated
          on my work, you must have a full input from the early stages and
          through the entire painting process. This way you can comment on and/
          or make possible suggestions as I'm painting. Even once the portrait
          is completed you can request contingent alternations if you are not
          completely happy with the end result.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like me to make alternations to the portrait once it has
          been delivered to your home (even if you approved the final scan), you
          must contact me within 7 days, send the portrait back to my studio and
          pay the shipping costs to me and back.
        </p>

        <h3>Currency Exchange</h3>
        <p>
          Since I'm based in Sweden, prices on this website are quoted in SEK
          (Swedish Krona), however you can view all prices in your currency. The
          conversions are never exact, but Paypal should charge your Credit /
          Debit card based on actual current exchange rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          I cannot be held responsible for any loss due to exchange rate
          fluctuations. Since you pay only half to start and it takes a while
          before your next payment is made, the exchange rates can change. If
          you are concerned about about exchange rate fluctuations, you can pay
          your portrait in full when you order. If this is the case, please
          <a href="/html/contact-pet-portrait-artist.html">contact me.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Portrait Delivery &amp; Delivery Times</h3>
        <p>
          I deliver my portraits worldwide, using
          <strong>FedEx Express</strong> - a convenient
          <strong>door-to-door delivery</strong>. View shipping and packaging
          costs on my
          <a href="/html/pet-portrait-commission-prices.html">price-list</a>.
          Delivery outside EU may be subject to local import taxes, which are
          the customers responsibility. Read more under headline Responsibility
          for Paying Taxes and Quarantines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work on a first come first served basis and delivery-times depend on
          my workload at the time you place the order.
          <a href="/html/contact-pet-portrait-artist.html">Contact me</a> to
          find out how much work I have at this time. If you require a portrait
          with a very short deadline, I can never fully guarantee that you will
          receive the portrait in time for the occasion. Read two reasons below:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            It is hard for me to predict the exact amount of working hours a
            portrait requires
          </li>
          <li>
            It is hard to predict exact delivery times and customs clearance
            (import) delays
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I always do my best, but sometimes not even my best is enough
          unfortunately. Please purchase a Gift Voucher if you have a short
          deadline.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment &amp; Security</h3>
        <p>
          To order and secure your space on my client list you will only need to
          place a small deposit amount. I take half of the total cost before I
          start, you need to pay the balance up to 50% just right before I
          start. Rest of the amount, 50% balance is paid once the portrait is
          completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          All payments are made safely through Paypal with help of their highly
          secured servers. Anyone knows how seriously Paypal take security and
          with their automatic fraud screening and Seller Protection Policy,
          they keep both me and you safe. PayPal is PCI compliant.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy Policy &amp; Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Personal information such as your e-mail, address or phone number will
          never be sold, distributed or given to third parties. I personally
          assure you that your personal information will never leave the
          confines of this website. If you do not wish to include your full name
          on my testimonial page, please do let me know. No Cookies are used on
          this website.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsibility for Paying Taxes &amp; Quarantines</h3>
        <p>
          I am not responsible for any possible additional costs such as
          <strong>Value Added Tax</strong> (VAT) /
          <strong>Goods &amp; Services Tax</strong> (GST) or
          <strong>quarantines</strong>. You as a customer must pay these fees
          upon import to your country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most countries don't charge VAT or GST percentages for original
          artwork because of it's tariff, however there are some exceptions and
          some of those are: <strong>Australia, New Zealand</strong> and
          <strong>Canada</strong>. The 10% GST is paid only if the final value
          exceed $1000 AUD. If you are unlucky, Australia or New Zealand can
          place imported goods to a quarantine which you as a recipient must
          pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you order a stretched oil painting I will make sure to use
          a Aluminium frame instead of a wooden one, all this to reduce any
          possibilities for a quarantine.
        </p>

        <h3>Reproduction Rights</h3>
        <p>
          Any artwork I create is commissioned for personal use only and can not
          be used for financial gain. I own the reproduction copyright on all my
          artwork, however, I never reproduce any custom work as I know it's
          personal and for you only.
        </p>
        <p>
          For your reproduction rights you have to pay an extra fee and the
          price is not included on my price-list. please
          <a href="/html/contact-pet-portrait-artist.html">contact me</a> for
          further information.
        </p>

        <h3>Damage in Transit</h3>
        <p>
          Always check the package for possible damage before acceppting your
          delivery. If the package is intact and the portrait or any other
          content has been damaged in transit you will have to photograph the
          damage and it's original packaging materials for FedEx - the courier
          company to review.
        </p>
        <p>
          Send the photos back to me and we can arrange what will be done. As
          the sender, I'm obligated to arrange and contact the courier company
          as soon as possible. Do not dispose any of the contents before our
          complaint and compensation has been arranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portraits travel insured and there is a possibility to get the
          money refunded from FedEx if the portrait arrives damaged. My
          portraits are packed to a very high standard, but sometimes damage do
          occur, especially on framings with glass.
        </p>

        <h3>Copyright Information</h3>
        <p>
          All images, text and design on my website are Copyrighted. Copyrights
          &copy; by Katja Turnsek - PetArt with Heart. No images, text or design
          can be used on other websites without my permission.
        </p>

        <h3>Gift Vouchers</h3>
        <p>
          Gift Vouchers are valid for 3 years and must be redeemed within 3
          years of purchase. Gift Vouchers cannot be exchanged for cash. Value,
          Date and Voucher number is written on each Gift voucher. The
          purchaser's full name is noted in a database. All this is done to help
          discovering possible fraud.
        </p>

        <h3>Bespoke Framing</h3>
        <p>
          Once the order has been done of your bespoke framing, you can't change
          your mind and cancel it. I do not frame the portraits myself. The
          professional framing company won't give any money back once they
          started on your order. We will chat about your requirements first and
          then do our best to meet your needs and make you happy with our work.
